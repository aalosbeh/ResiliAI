Fiscal Monitor: Database of Country Fiscal Measures in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
This database summarizes key fiscal measures governments have announced or taken in selected economies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as of June 5, 2021 for 20 G20 Advanced and Emerging Market Economies, 26 Non-G20 Advanced Economies, 82 Non-G20
Emerging Market Economies, 59 Low-Income Developing Countries. It includes COVID-19 related measures since January 2020 and covers measures for implementation in 2020, 2021, and beyond. The database categorizes different types of fiscal support (for example, above-theline and below-the line measures, and contingent liabilities) that have different implications for public finances in the near term and beyond. Please refer to Box 1.1 of the April 2020 Fiscal Monitor for details. The database is not meant for classifying the measures for fiscal reporting,
nor for comparison across economies as responses vary depending on country-specific circumstances, including the impact of the pandemic and other shocks. It focuses on government discretionary measures that supplement existing automatic stabilizers. These existing stabilizers
differ across countries in their breadth and scope. Estimates included here are preliminary as governments are taking additional measures or finalizing the details of individual measures. The information does not represent views of the IMF on the measures listed. Please see IMF
Policy Tracker (https://www.imf.org/COVID19policytracker) for information on a broader range of economies and their monetary and financial policies.

On April 9 2020, the euro area finance
ministers (Eurogroup) agreed on
establishing safety nets for workers,
businesses and sovereigns, amounting
to a package of which €340 bn were
below-the-line measures:
•A new and temporary EU
unemployment reinsurance fund
(SURE) will provide up to €100 bn in
loans on favorable terms to
governments, in support of national
unemployment, short-time work
schemes, and health-related
measures. Loans will be guaranteed by
the EU budget and EU member states.
The instrument will then be operational
until 31 December 2022.
•The ESM will provide Pandemic
Crisis Support to its members to
finance crisis-related health spending
of up to 2 percent of a requesting
member’s 2019 GDP. Should all 19
countries draw from the credit line, this
would amount to around €240 bn.The
loans from the ESM are meant to
finance direct and indirect healthrelated spending in response to the
Covid-19 crisis.
On December 11, EU leaders agreed
on the Next Generation EU (NGEU)
recovery package, which includes
€360 bn in loans from the Recovery
and Resilience Facility (RRF), for
which EU members can apply for to
finance parts of their national recovery
and resilience plans.

• Envelope for direct equity support
(mostly for strategic companies, e.g.,
Air France-KLM, SNCF).

• In April 2020, the European Commission announced that the size of the Corona
Response Investment Initiative will be raised to €37 bn, which includes an upfront
cash injection of €8 bn from the EU cohesion funds, to support public investment for
hospitals, labor markets, and stressed regions. The Commission extended the scope
of the EU Solidarity Fund by also including a public health crisis within its scope, in
view of mobilizing it if needed for the hardest hit EU member states. The Coronavirus
Response Investment Initiative Plus (CRII+) introduced greater flexibility to allow that
all non-utilized support from the European cohesion funds can be mobilized to the
fullest. This flexibility is provided for through: transfer possibilities across the three
cohesion policy funds (the European Regional Development Fund, European Social
Fund and Cohesion Fund); transfers between the different categories of regions;
flexibility when it comes to thematic concentration; and a 100% EU co-financing rate
for cohesion policy programs for the accounting year 2020-2021, allowing Member
States to benefit for full EU financing for crisis-related measures.
•On December 11, EU leaders agreed on the Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery
package, which includes €390 bn in grants to EU members. The main instrument is
the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), which will fund member countries’
investments and reforms. The NGEU’s grant element comprises: €312.5 bn is from
the RRF and will be committed in 2021–2023 (70 percent for 2021 and 2022 and 30
percent for 2023); €47.5 bn to top up cohesion funds (ReactEU) that can be used for
investments and expenditures related to the crisis (e.g., investing in active labor
market policies, short-time work schemes); €10 bn to top up to the Just Transition
Fund to help regions/workers dependent on carbon intensive industries transition
away from those industries; R&D (€5 bn); support for private sector investment (€5.6
bn), rural development (€7.5 bn), and rescEU (€1.9 bn).
• As of early June, 2021, 24 EU countries had submitted national Recovery and
Resilience Plans (RRPs). The first disbursements are expected to begin in July 2021.

Guarantees (on loans, deposits etc.)

•The EU Council agreed on a new panEuropean guarantee fund of €25 bn, which
could support €200 bn of total financing for
hard-hit SMEs throughout the European
Investment Bank or national development
banks. The guarantee fund comes on top of
an earlier support package of up to €40 bn for
the European Investment Bank in March, and
both packages are likely to be funded by
voluntary contributions from member states.

• State guarantees for bank loans to
companies and credit reinsurance schemes
(€315 bn); other guarantees (€12.5 bn).
• The recovery plan also includes the creation
of a up to €20 bn fund leveraged by public
guarantees (€7 bn), to provide quasi-equity
support or equity loans to firms.

(iii) €400 bn to provide additional state
guarantees to non-financial corporations to
alleviate liquidity bottlenecks and support
refinancing.
• For the new and expansion of the existing
KfW-programs, the guarantee framework of
the federal government was increased by
€357 bn.
• Total guarantees provided by state
governments to be increased by €70 bn.

The total guarantee is estimated at about 579
bn euros, aimed to unlock more than 750
billion euros of liquidity for businesses and
households. (Note that the amount reported
here is the originally announced ceiling, and
the current level of contracted guarantees is
about one-fourth of the announced).

Sources: National authorities and IMF staff estimates.

Note: Estimates as of June 5, 2021. Numbers in U.S. dollar and percent of GDP are based on July 2021 World Economic Outlook unless otherwise stated. The fiscal measures include resources allocated or planned in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic since January 2020, which will cover implementation in 2020, 2021, and beyond.
The country list includes European Union as well, but the total global fiscal support does not include measures announced by the European Union because those are financing the measures by member states, which are included individually.
The global estimate of fiscal support includes above-the-line measures of additional spending and foregone revenue, as well as below the line measures and contingent liabilities from guarantees and quasi-fiscal operations.
1
Norway fiscal support measures expressed in percent of continental GDP.
2
The numbers are based on official estimates covering cumulative spending in 2020 and the first five months of 2021.
3
The American Families (AFP) and the American Job (AJP) plans are not included in this version of the database as their final size and measures, as well as the degree to which the measures are COVID-related remains uncertain.
